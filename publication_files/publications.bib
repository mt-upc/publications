However, it is difficult for existing deep learning architectures to learn a new task without largely forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Furthermore, CL is particularly challenging for language learning, as natural language is ambiguous: it is discrete, compositional, and its meaning is context-dependent. In this work, we look at the problem of CL through the lens of various NLP tasks. Our survey discusses major challenges in CL and current methods applied in neural network models. We also provide a critical review of the existing CL evaluation methods and datasets in NLP. Finally, we present our outlook on future research directions.",

	abstract = {Abstract A common intermediate language representation in neural machine translation can be used to extend bilingual systems by incremental training. We propose a new architecture based on introducing an interlingual loss as an additional training objective. By adding and forcing this interlingual loss, we can train multiple encoders and decoders for each language, sharing among them a common intermediate representation. Translation results on the low-resource tasks (Turkish-English and Kazakh-English tasks) show a BLEU improvement of up to 2.8 points. However, results on a larger dataset (Russian-English and Kazakh-English) show BLEU losses of a similar amount. While our system provides improvements only for the low-resource tasks in terms of translation quality, our system is capable of quickly deploying new language pairs without the need to retrain the rest of the system, which may be a game changer in some situations. Specifically, what is most relevant regarding our architecture is that it is capable of: reducing the number of production systems, with respect to the number of languages, from quadratic to linear; incrementally adding a new language to the system without retraining the languages already there; and allowing for translations from the new language to all the others present in the system.}

The dominant approaches use subword-level tokens, but this increases the length of the sequences and makes it difficult to profit from word-level information such as POS tags or semantic dependencies. We propose a modification to the Transformer model to combine subword-level representations into word-level ones in the first layers of the encoder, reducing the effective length of the sequences in the following layers and providing a natural point to incorporate extra word-level information. Our experiments show that this approach maintains the translation quality with respect to the normal Transformer model when no extra word-level information is injected and that it is superior to the currently dominant method for incorporating word-level source language information to models based on subword-level vocabularies.",

In this paper, we study the performance of two popular approaches: statistical and neural. We conclude that both methods yield similar results; however, the performance varies depending on the language pair. While the statistical approach outperforms the neural one by a difference of 6 BLEU points for the Spanish-Portuguese language pair, the proposed neural model surpasses the statistical one by a difference of 2 BLEU points for Czech-Polish. In the former case, the language similarity (based on perplexity) is much higher than in the latter case. Additionally, we report negative results for the system combination with back-translation. Our TALP-UPC system submission won 1st place for Czech-{\textgreater}Polish and 2nd place for Spanish-{\textgreater}Portuguese in the official evaluation of the 1st WMT Similar Language Translation task.",

Far beyond this, these architectures are the basis for the contextual word embeddings which are revolutionizing most natural language downstream applications. However, intermediate representations in either the RNN or Transformer architectures can be difficult to interpret. To make these layer representations more accessible and meaningful, we introduce a web-based tool that visualizes them both at the sentence and token level. We present three use cases. The first analyses gender issues in contextual word embeddings. The second and third are showing multilingual intermediate representations for sentences and tokens and the evolution of these intermediate representations along with the multiple layers of the decoder and in the context of multilingual machine translation.",

Neural models are trained on large text corpora which contain biases and stereotypes. As a consequence, models inherit these social biases. Recent methods have shown results in reducing gender bias in other natural language processing tools such as word embeddings. We take advantage of the fact that word embeddings are used in neural machine translation to propose a method to equalize gender biases in neural machine translation using these representations. Specifically, we propose, experiment and analyze the integration of two debiasing techniques over GloVe embeddings in the Transformer translation architecture. We evaluate our proposed system on the WMT English-Spanish benchmark task, showing gains up to one BLEU point. As for the gender bias evaluation, we generate a test set of occupations and we show that our proposed system learns to equalize existing biases from the baseline system.",

    abstract = "Catalan and Spanish are two related languages given that both derive from Latin. They share similarities in several linguistic levels including morphology, syntax and semantics. This makes them particularly interesting for the MT task. Given the recent appearance and popularity of neural MT, this paper analyzes the performance of this new approach compared to the well-established rule-based and phrase-based MT systems. Experiments are reported on a large database of 180 million words. Results, in terms of standard automatic measures, show that neural MT clearly outperforms the rule-based and phrase-based MT system on in-domain test set, but it is worst in the out-of-domain test set. A naive system combination specially works for the latter. In-domain manual analysis shows that neural MT tends to improve both adequacy and fluency, for example, by being able to generate more natural translations instead of literal ones, choosing to the adequate target word when the source word has several translations and improving gender agreement. However, out-of-domain manual analysis shows how neural MT is more affected by unknown words or contexts.",

These models are assumed to be capable of learning reorderings of sequences of words. However, the difference in word order between two languages is one of the most important sources of errors in SMT. This paper proposes a Recursive Alignment Block Classification algorithm (RABCA) that can take advantage of inductive learning in order to solve reordering problems. This algorithm should be able to cope with swapping examples seen during training; it should infer properties that might permit to reorder pairs of blocks (sequences of words) which did not appear during training; and finally it should be robust with respect to training errors and ambiguities. Experiments are reported on the EuroParl task and RABCA is tested using two state-of-the-art SMT systems: a phrased-based and an Ngram-based. In both cases, RABCA improves results.",

Participants of the challenge are requested to build hybrid translations by combining the output of several MT systems of different types. We first describe the ML4HMT corpus used in the shared task, then explain the XLIFF-based annotation format we have designed for it, and briefly summarize the participating systems. Using both automated metrics scores and extensive manual evaluation, we discuss the individual performance of the various systems. An interesting result from the shared task is the fact that we were able to observe different systems winning according to the automated metrics scores when compared to the results from the manual evaluation. We conclude by summarising the first edition of the challenge and by giving an outlook to future work.",

As a first step towards achieving this objective we have developed a parallel corpus with source text and the corresponding translation output from a number of machine translation engines, annotated with metadata information, capturing aspects of the translation process performed by the different MT systems. This corpus aims to serve as a basic resource for further research on whether hybrid machine translation algorithms and system combination techniques can benefit from additional (linguistically motivated, decoding, and runtime) information provided by the different systems involved. In this paper, we describe the annotated corpus we have created. We provide an overview on the component MT systems and the XLIFF-based annotation format we have developed. We also report on first experiments with the ML4HMT corpus data.",

Since both paradigms have largely been used during the last years, one of the aims in the research community is to know how these systems differ in terms of translation quality. To this end, this paper reports a study and comparison of a rule-based and a corpus-based (particularly, statistical) Catalan-Spanish machine translation systems, both of them freely available in the web. The translation quality analysis is performed under two different domains: journalistic and medical. The systems are evaluated by using standard automatic measures, as well as by native human evaluators. Automatic results show that the statistical system performs better than the rule-based system. Human judgements show that in the Spanish-to-Catalan direction the statistical system also performs better than the rule-based system, while in the Catalan-to-Spanish direction is the other way round. Although the statistical system obtains the best automatic scores, its errors tend to be more penalized by human judgements than the errors of the rule-based system. This can be explained because statistical errors are usually unexpected and they do not follow any pattern.",

How to automatically detect them is onequestion that is gaining interest in the natural language processing community. The main contribution of this paper is toevaluate the quality of the recently developed {''}Spanish Database for cyberbullying prevention{''} for the purpose of trainingclassifiers on detecting abusive short texts. We compare classical machine learning techniques to the use of a more ad-vanced model: the contextual word embeddings in the particular case of classification of abusive short-texts for the Spanishlanguage. As contextual word embeddings, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), pro-posed at the end of 2018. We show that BERT mostly outperforms classical techniques. Far beyond the experimentalimpact of our research, this project aims at planting the seeds for an innovative technological tool with a high potentialsocial impact and aiming at being part of the initiatives in artificial intelligence for social good.",
